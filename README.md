📝 MyTaskPlanner - To-Do App UI

Project Description:
I created a simple yet efficient MyTaskPlanner UI using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite as a learning project to enhance my front-end development skills. The application features a clean and responsive design aimed at improving task management for users.

Features:
✅ Intuitive UI—Streamlined layout for easy task creation and tracking
✅ Interactive Elements—Handles user interactions with custom functions like onCheck and onChange
✅ Adaptive Design—Delivers a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
✅ Persistent Data—Stores all todos in localStorage to ensure tasks remain available even after closing the browser

Key Learnings:
🔹 Enhanced my understanding of React.js, particularly in creating reusable components
🔹 Learned to use React hooks (useState and useEffect) for state management and side effects
🔹 Gained experience in applying Tailwind CSS for responsive, visually appealing designs
🔹 Developed functional programming skills through writing interactive features
🔹 Implemented localStorage for persistent data storage and better user experience
